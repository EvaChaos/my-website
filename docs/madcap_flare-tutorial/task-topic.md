## Edit your topic

		MadCap Flare allows you to edit your topic’s content in multiple ways. Let’s take a closer look at two options that will help you to make your topic more interactive: drop-down text and multimedia.

---

### Add drop-down text

			The drop-down text option is useful when you want to hide the information that is optional or non-essential for your audience. The user can still access it by clicking the drop-down arrow.

:::note
Drop-down text appears as normal text in print outputs.
:::

To create drop-down text, use the following instructions:

1. Create a text for your topic.
2. Place the cursor where you want the drop-down to appear.
3. To open the **Insert** ribbon, select the **Insert** tab.
4. In the **Text** section, click the **Drop-Down Text** icon.

5. To save the changes, select **File** > **Save** or press Ctrl + S.

Grey brackets appear around the selected text. The text is displayed as drop-down text in online outputs.

### Add multimedia

MadCap Flare allows you to insert multimedia content like videos directly into your  project's topic. You can either upload the external videos saved on your device or paste a link to a video in the URL field. 

:::note

The types of multimedia you can insert include:

- Flash Movies
- Windows Media Player
- HTML5 Videos
- QuickTime Movies
- Mimic Movie
- 3D Model
- YouTube/Vimeo videos
:::

To insert embedded video, do the following:

1. Place the cursor where you want to insert a video and go to the **Insert** tab.
2. Click **Multimedia** > **YouTube/Vimeo**.

3. The **Insert Multimedia** window opens. From the **General** tab, choose one of the following options:
	- If you want to select a video file already in the project, choose **Multimedia in project**.
	- If you want to embed a YouTube or Vimeo video, paste the URL in the field.
4. (Optional) In the **Screen Tip** field, type in a phrase that appears when the user holds the pointer over the video link in the output.
5. (Optional)  In the **Alternate Text** field, type in alternate text that is displayed when the video is not available. This might be helpful for people who use screen readers.
6. Click **OK**.

# Requirements for Node.js

All right, so now you must be having a clear view of Node.js and how it can be an important asset to your skillset. Let’s further understand what are the prerequisites for learning Node.js

| Prerequisites| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
 JavaScript| Node.js’s environment is developed for writing JavaScript code, hence we must have an adequate understanding of the core and advanced concepts of JavaScript.|
 Asynchronous code | Asynchronous code or architecture means the program can do multiple tasks simultaneously without disturbing the main thread execution. |
CLI | Command Line Interface also known as CLI is a text-based user interface through which you can type commands to make your computer execute certain tasks. Once you are comfortable with using CLI, then you will get a hang of running nvm, npm as well as executing your Node.js projects easily. |
NPM | Node Package Manager or the NPM is a very powerful tool that helps in managing the server-side dependencies of any Node.js project. Through NPM, one can easily install, upgrade or even delete various libraries or packages of JavaScript when required. |
http | In situations where you need to retrieve data from a data source or send certain data, you will need to make an API request to that server through HTTP. Having a basic knowledge of HTTP requests and HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc., will be beneficial for you while working on a web project.|
eS6+ Syntax | Currently, for JavaScript, the ECMAScript 2015 or ES6 is the standard scripting language. ES6 is the second major revision which involves important features like the let and const keyword, for loops, default parameters, arrow functions, classes and many more. Hence it is advised to be familiar with all these features. |

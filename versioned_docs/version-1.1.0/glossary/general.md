  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> End-to-end encryption (E2EE)</td>
      <td>E2EE is an encryption standard that focuses on protecting the exchange of data from device to device. Data is encrypted on the sender’s device and decrypted on the recipient’s device – never in the cloud.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> FIDO2 </td>
      <td>FIDO2 is an open authentication standard that enables users to log into desktop or mobile applications without using passwords. Instead, FIDO2 lets you use gestures such as PINs, touch, or biometrics.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hard-coding</td>
      <td>Hard-coding is an unsafe programming practice for password storage. Exposure to a single hard-coded credential could put the entire organization at risk. An effective password management solution solves this with a set of secure APIs for application-to-application (A-to-A) and application-to-database (A-to-DB) password management.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hashing</td>
      <td>Hashing is a cryptographic method used to change datasets and characters of any length into compact, fixed hash values. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2-factor authentication (2FA)</td>
      <td>2FA is a security method that requires two forms of identification to access resources and data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Zero-knowledge architecture</td>
      <td>Zero-knowledge architecture is a security model that uses a unique encryption and data segregation framework to protect against remote data breaches. Providers know nothing about the data you store on their servers.</td>
    </tr>

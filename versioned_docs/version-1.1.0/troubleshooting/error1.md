# Error: invalid master password

SecureVault uses [zero-knowledge](glossary/general.md) encryption to save data on its server. This means that SecureVault has zero knowledge of how to retrieve or reset your master password. There are, however, a few steps you can take to regain access to your account:

1. Double-check if the credentials you enter are correct.
2. Try logging in on another device.
3. Use a master password hint.  If you have one set up, a hint will be emailed to your inbox once you click **Get master password hint** on your login page.
3. If you have emergency access enabled, contact your trusted emergency contact to regain access to your account. Note that trusted emergency contacts must have a SecureVault account of their own.

If none of these options works, you have to delete your account and set up a new one. Go to **My account**>**Danger zone** and select **Delete account**.

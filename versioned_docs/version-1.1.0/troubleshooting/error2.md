# Error: unable to auto-fill selected item

**Auto-fill** may not work correctly if the device’s operating system cannot identify the login fields that need to be filled. If SecureVault doesn’t pop up to autofill for an app or website, try these steps:

1. Make sure [**Auto-fill** is enabled](getstarted/key_features.md#Advanced) on your device.
2. Double-check battery optimization settings on your device. If battery optimization is on for SecureVault, turn it off.
3. Uninstall other password managers in the browser.
4. Clear cookies and cache.
5. Update your browser.
6. Manually trigger the **Auto-fill** option. Right-click the password field and select **SecureVault**>**Auto-fill login**>**Unlock your vault**. Check if this fixes the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please contact us at support@smartsoft.com.
